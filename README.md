# Melissa's Website 3.0

I get bored of my designs too easily LOL??? Hopefully this version will last a long time. I combined everything I love in designs and everything I've learnt into this.

If reuse: 
- You can mostly just change the text in the `constants` folder. This is still WIP so it's not perfect yet. 
- DO NOT REMOVE THE FOOTER.

To-dos:
- Make responsive navbar
- Make dark mode
