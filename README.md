## reuse

In **any** case of reuse, DO NOT REMOVE THE FOOTER. everything else can be changed.

If you are not a developer, simply go to the `src` folder, find the `constants` folder and edit accordingly:
- `hero.ts` is for the home section of the site;
- `navbar.ts` is to edit the links of the navigation bar;
- `about.ts` is to edit the about section;
- `projects.ts` is to edit the projects section;
- `experiences.ts` is to edit the experiences section.

`styles.ts` is to edit the custom CSS styles. Editing it is **not** recommended, especially if you are not familiar with Tailwind CSS. 

You may edit `colors.ts` to determine the color of the background and the text for dark and light modes.
